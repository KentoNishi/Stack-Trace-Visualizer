* Submitted to: `Mr. Kwong`
* Project Manager: `Kento Nishi`
* Date: `April 28th, 2020`
* Project Name: `Stack Trace Visualizer`
* Project Overview: The program keeps track of every method call in a Java program to generate a tree-like view showing every step in the program. The program will have a graphical interface for users to profile the execution of their Java programs. The application will mainly serve Java developers in making debugging easier.
* Project Team: `N/A`
* Challenges:
    * Judging from research so far, the program may require clever workarounds within the code to function properly.
    * The program *may* be restricted to a specific Java version or OS.
